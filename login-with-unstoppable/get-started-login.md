## Step 1: Get Your Client Credentials

To begin the integration process for Login with Unstoppable, you will need to obtain and configure your client credentials using the **My Clients** and **Client Configuration** pages. Please see the [**Login Client Configuration**](/login-with-unstoppable/login-integration-guides/login-client-configuration.md) guide for more details.

When you've customized your client and saved your changes, you will need the **Client Metadata** to configure your integration. This can be copied directly from the first section of the **Client Configuration** page.

```javascript
{
    clientID: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    redirectUri: "http://localhost",
    scope: "openid . . . "
}
```

</figure>

## Step 2: Configure Login Scopes

The `scope` property from your client metadata will contain all available scopes by default, some of which are mutually exclusive. The minimum scope required for login is `openid`.

See [Scopes for Login](./scopes-for-login.md) for more details on each of these.

## Step 3: Choose Your Integration Path

:::info
The [UAuth Demo Application](https://uauth-demo.uc.r.appspot.com) is available for developer use along with a [single page sample application](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/uauth/tree/main/examples/spa/src) to model the flow. Applications can also use Unstoppable Domainâ€™s [UAuth Library](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/uauth) to simplify the integration.

## Step 4: Configure the Login UI

Login with Unstoppable has UI requirements that must be configured to properly display the authenticated user's domain name after a successful login. Please follow the instructions in the [**Login UI Configuration**](/login-with-unstoppable/login-integration-guides/login-ui-configuration.mdx) guide to complete this final step in the integration process.

## Step 5: Promote Your Application

Once your integration is live, you can [promote your application](/use-cases/promote-ud-integration.md) by submitting it to the official UD [app integrations database](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps).
