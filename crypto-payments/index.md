# Send and Receive Crypto Payments

Unstoppable Domains allows you to make payments with over [281 cryptocurrencies](https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001185621-what-cryptocurrencies-are-currently-supported-) using a single domain name. As long as you have configured your addresses to the domain, our members can send crypto to your domain, and it will end up in your wallet.

Still confused about how it works? If you own the `ryan.crypto` domain and BTC is sent to that domain, you will receive it at your BTC address. If ETH is also sent to that domain, you will receive it at your ETH address. Unstoppable Domains achieves this with a process called domain resolution.

## Domain Resolution Overview

Domain resolution is the process of converting a human-readable domain name like `ryan.crypto` to the cryptocurrency addresses attached to them. It involves retrieving a domain’s records through [smart contracts](/developer-toolkit/reference/smart-contracts/uns-smart-contracts.md) deployed on the blockchain.

## How Domain Resolution Works

In the demo above, we sent 1 `ETH` to the `ryan.crypto` domain. The application sends both parameters (currency and domain) to the [Resolver contract](/developer-toolkit/reference/smart-contracts/uns-smart-contracts.md#resolver) on the Ethereum blockchain, which returns the `crypto.ETH.address` record attached to that domain. The resolved address is used to complete the ETH transfer to Ryan’s wallet.

A domain can store many records and key formats. To learn about our supported record types, see our [Records Reference](/developer-toolkit/reference/records-reference.md) guide.
