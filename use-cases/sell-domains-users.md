# Sell Domains to Users in Your App

This page outlines the use case for reselling Unstoppable Domains to users in your application. As a UD Partner, you can earn extra revenue for your business, while increasing the visibility of your application.

## How does it work?

We will provide you with several tools to establish yourself as an official Unstoppable Domains Partner. You can configure several integration pathways for your application, including allowing your users to mint both paid and free domains.

## Are there working integrations for this feature?

Blockchain.com is our most recent UD Partner. Blockchain.com has 31 million users who can now purchase free and paid Unstoppable Domains directly in Blockchain.com's application.

You can find additional working integrations on UD's Applications List, filtered by the [Partner feature](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps?filters=4).

## How do I get started?

If you want to resell domains, you must first [Register as a Partner](/partner/index.md) with Unstoppable Domains and [configure a payment method](/partner/integration-paths.md) for your partner account. You can process payments natively using Stripe or Coinbase, or you can use [UD's Redirect URL payment flow](/partner/partner-integration-guides/redirect-url-payments.md) where we process the payments on your behalf. See the [Partner API Spec](/openapi/reference/) for detailed parameters.
