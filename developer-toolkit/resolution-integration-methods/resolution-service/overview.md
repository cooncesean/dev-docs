# Resolution Service API

The Resolution Service provides an API for getting domain data and metadata regardless of the blockchain in which the domain is stored. The service caches blockchain events in a database for easy retrieval without accessing any blockchain APIs.

With the Resolution Service API, you can quickly build applications directly communicating with the blockchain to get UD domain data with a single API request.

## Supported Domains Endings

The Resolution Service API supports decentralized domains across two main zones:

| Name Service                   | Supported Domains                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Zilliqa Name Service (ZNS)     | `.zil`                                                                                 |
| Unstoppable Name Service (UNS) | `.crypto`, `.nft`, `.blockchain`, `.bitcoin`, `.coin`, `.wallet,` `.888`, `.dao`, `.x` |
