## Configuration

Resolution libraries require a connection to the Ethereum network to resolve `.crypto` and `.eth` domains. To initialize the library, you need to specify an Ethereum node service provider. Once you create the instance, you can begin resolving domains. Below are examples of how to initialize the library with different providers.

### Provider URL

Each of the Resolution Libraries supports an Ethereum provider URL for configuration. You can obtain a provider URL from a service like Alchemy, where getting an API key is free and only requires creating an account.

To choose an alternative Ethereum provider see the [Nodes as a Service](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) guide.
