Unstoppable Domains periodically releases new domain endings, and our Resolution libraries and APIs will automatically detect and support them. Therefore, do not implement a front-end filter into your application (e.g., hard-coding domains or placing a regex filter for just .crypto, .nft, etc.). We also provide an [API endpoint to query for supported domain endings](/developer-toolkit/resolution-integration-methods/resolution-service/endpoints/get-supported-tlds.md).
