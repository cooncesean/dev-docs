# Register as a Partner

:::warning
The Partner API only supports domains and wallets on the Polygon L2 network. See the [Polygon Developer Integration Guide](/polygon/polygon-migration-guide.md) to get started.
:::

## Step 1: Create an Account

You must create an account in the [Unstoppable Domains Partner Dashboard](https://unstoppabledomains.com/resellers) to get started.

After your application is approved, you will be given full access to the partner dashboard to view your ResellerID and update payment information.

:::info
To avoid missing the email about your partner application status, please update your email settings to approve messages from [notifications@unstoppabledomains.com](mailto:notifications@unstoppabledomains.com), so it doesn’t end up in your spam folder.
:::

## Step 3: Configure Payment Information

The Partner API must be configured with one or more payment options before users can begin purchasing domains. Please follow the instructions in the **[Partner Integration Guides](integration-paths.md)** to integrate one or more payment methods for your partner account.
